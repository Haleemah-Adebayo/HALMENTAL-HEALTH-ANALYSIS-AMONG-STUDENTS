üîç Project Overview

This project explores the various factors influencing mental health among students, using data visualization and analysis techniques. The objective was to understand how academic pressure, work/study habits, financial stress, dietary habits, and demographics impact students‚Äô mental well-being and academic performance.

The analysis was conducted using a dashboard built from survey data, and it aimed to reveal actionable insights for educational institutions, mental health professionals, and student support organizations.

üìä Key Insights

1. Demographics & CGPA

Age Group with Highest CGPA: Students aged 23‚Äì27 had the highest CGPA, indicating better academic outcomes among mature students.

CGPA Declines with Age beyond 27, suggesting academic pressure may take a toll or academic engagement reduces over time.

2. Gender & Depression

Most Depressed Gender: Male students had higher depression counts (9,115) compared to females (7,221).

Suggests male students may struggle more silently with stress, possibly due to societal stigma around vulnerability.

3. Academic & Workload Pressure

Top Stress Stage: Class 12 was identified as the most academically stressful period.

Work/Study Hours vs CGPA: Students studying 10‚Äì12 hours had the highest CGPA, but this intensity may contribute to poor mental health if not managed properly.

Depression Increases With Lower Satisfaction: As satisfaction with studies decreased (scale 5 ‚Üí 1), depression levels rose significantly.

4. Financial Stress

Top 5 Financially Stressed Cities:

Kalyan (1,570)

Srinagar (1,372)

Hyderabad (1,340)

Vasai-Virar (1,290)

Lucknow (1,155)

Students in these cities likely face heightened economic hardship, correlating with increased anxiety and depression.

5. Dietary Habits & Mental Health

Most Depressed by Diet: Students with unhealthy diets accounted for 7,297 depression cases.

Healthy diets correlated with lower levels of depression (~3,473), reinforcing the link between nutrition and mental health.

6. Family History

Family History and Depression: A near-equal number of students with depression had a family history (8,273) vs those without (8,063), indicating that while genetics is a factor, environmental and lifestyle aspects are equally impactful.

üìå Recommendations

1. Targeted Mental Health Programs

Create male-focused support spaces and workshops that normalize open discussions around stress and emotions.

Introduce stress management resources in Class 12, including counseling and mindfulness training.

2. Health & Nutrition Awareness

Collaborate with nutritionists and mental health experts to embed wellness modules into the student curriculum.

Promote healthy dietary habits through awareness campaigns and on-campus meal programs.

3. City-Based Interventions

Focused financial counseling and mental health clinics should be prioritized in high-stress urban areas (e.g., Kalyan, Srinagar).

Offer scholarship guidance, budgeting workshops, and part-time job portals for students in need.

4. Academic Satisfaction Monitoring

Implement semester-based feedback systems to track student satisfaction with academic programs and adjust workloads or teaching styles accordingly.

5. Early Screening & Support

Encourage voluntary mental health screenings especially for students with a known family history of depression.

Train academic advisors to identify early warning signs and offer referrals.

üéØ Conclusion

This analysis reveals the layered and interconnected factors influencing student mental health. While academic success is often measured by CGPA, the unseen pressure of performance, finances, diet, and personal history can deeply affect students.

Educational institutions must adopt a holistic approach‚Äîfostering not just academic excellence but emotional resilience and well-being. With the right data and actionable insights, we can build healthier, more supportive academic environments.
